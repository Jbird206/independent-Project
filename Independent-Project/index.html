    <h2>About me</h2>
    <div class="aboutme">
      <p> I've been a Seattle resident for twenty years, originally from Minneapolis with some time residing in Chicago. Most of my time here has been spent living in the Capitol Hill neighborhood as well as downtown.
        I'm married and have two dogs, enjoy cooking, reading, painting and computers.</p>

    <h2>Background and education</h2>
    <p>Initially I studied fine art, but the cost of private school and supporting myself became an overwhelming burden. So for the last two decades I've been working as a Bartender in various hotels, lounges and restaurants.All of which had served
      me well. Several years ago however I became interested in game server hosting and then eventually, game modding. It was the modding end that got me interested in code, the functionality and puzzle of it all. After expressing to some of the tech
      workers in Seattle about my hobby, they asked why I haven't made a career of it. And frankly, they had a good point. So started my quest for an education in coding.</p>
